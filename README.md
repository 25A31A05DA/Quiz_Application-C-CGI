# Quiz_Application-C-CGI
Web-based quiz application implemented using C via CGI. The frontend is built with HTML and CSS, while the backend logic is handled by a C program executed on an Apache server. The project demonstrates client–server interaction, form handling, and dynamic HTML generation without using databases or modern frameworks.
